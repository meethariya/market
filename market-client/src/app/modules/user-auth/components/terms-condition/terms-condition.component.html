          Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before
          using our application ("BigMart") that collects and uses age and

          to ensure privacy and confidentiality.<br /><br />

          2.3 Anonymization and Aggregation:<br />
          We will take appropriate measures to anonymize and aggregate the
